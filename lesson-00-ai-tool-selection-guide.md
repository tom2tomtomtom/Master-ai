## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Selection Mistakes & Fixes

**Problem**: "I need ALL the AI tools"
**Solution**: Start with one, expert it, then expand. 80/20 rule applies

**Problem**: "Free versions are good enough"
**Solution**: Calculate time lost to limitations - usually paid versions pay for themselves in days

**Problem**: "My team won't adopt new tools"
**Solution**: Start solo, show results, then train others with proven workflows

**Problem**: "Tools keep changing/updating"
**Solution**: Focus on core principles, not specific features - adapt as needed

### Pro Tips for Tool Selection Success:

1. **The 7-Day Rule**: Use free trial intensively for 7 days before deciding
2. **Stack Simplicity**: Better to expert 2 tools than struggle with 10
3. **Use Case First**: Choose tools based on problems, not features
4. **Community Matters**: Active communities = better learning and support
5. **Integration is King**: Tools that work together multiply value
6. **Track Everything**: Document time savings from day 1 for motivation
