## The Problem Many professionals find

Documents are information prisons:
- You have hundreds of PDFs, reports, and spreadsheets but no time to read them
- Important insights are buried in 50-page documents
- You need to compare information across multiple files
- Data analysis feels overwhelming when you're not a data expert
- You spend hours reading to find one key piece of information

Traditional document review is like looking for a needle in a haystack - time-consuming and often fruitless.

Claude transforms this completely. It's like having a brilliant research assistant who can instantly read, analyze, and extract insights from any document or data file.
