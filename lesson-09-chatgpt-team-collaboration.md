## The Problem Many professionals find

Your team is using AI, but it's chaos:
- Everyone has different prompts for the same tasks
- Quality varies wildly between team members
- No one knows what AI tools others are using
- Sensitive information might be shared inappropriately

Today we're turning you into the AI leader who creates systematic, scalable AI adoption across your entire team with shared best practices, governance, and measurable results.

## Skill Building (20 minutes)

### Exercise 1: AI Governance & Best Practices Framework (7 minutes)
*Create guidelines that ensure responsible and effective team AI use*

**Your Mission**: Establish team AI governance that balances productivity with security

**The Old Way**(Don't do this):
- Let everyone use AI however they want
- No guidelines on data privacy or security
- Inconsistent quality across team outputs
- No measurement of AI impact or ROI
- Time Wasted: Countless hours on inconsistent results
- Risk Level: High (data security, compliance issues)**The AI Way**(Do this instead):**Team AI Governance Framework**:
```
1. APPROVED AI TOOLS
 Approved: ChatGPT Team, Claude Pro, [YOUR APPROVED TOOLS]
 Restricted: Free tools for sensitive data, unapproved AI services

2. DATA CLASSIFICATION
 Confidential: Never share with AI (customer data, financials, IP)
 Internal: OK with approved enterprise AI tools only
 Public: Safe to use with any AI tool

3. QUALITY STANDARDS
 All AI outputs must be reviewed before external use
 Use shared prompts and templates for consistency
 Track and measure AI productivity improvements

4. SHARED RESOURCES
 Team custom GPTs for common workflows
 Prompt library for frequent use cases
 Regular training and best practice sharing

5. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
 Follow company data policies
 Document AI use for audit trails
 Regular review of AI governance effectiveness
```

**Customize It**:
- Add your industry-specific compliance requirements
- Include your company's data classification system
- Specify approval processes for your organization

**Try It Now**:
1. Create a simple AI governance document for your team
2. Share it and get feedback from 2-3 team members
3. Refine based on their input and concerns

**Success Check**:
"Do you have clear guidelines that balance AI productivity with security and quality? Does your team understand what's approved and what's not? You just created responsible AI leadership!"
