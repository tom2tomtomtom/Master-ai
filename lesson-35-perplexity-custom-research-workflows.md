## The Problem Many professionals find

You need to conduct regular research tasks, but you're spending too much time on:
- Manual market research
- Repetitive competitor analysis
- Tracking industry trends
- Monitoring news and developments
- Compiling research reports

The old way? Manually conducting research tasks repeatedly, or hiring expensive analysts.

Today you're learning to create automated research workflows that run continuously and deliver insights on schedule.

**What You'll Save**: 2-4 hours per week of manual research 
**What You'll Gain**: Automated insights + continuous monitoring + competitive advantage 
**What You'll Need**: Perplexity API + workflow automation tools

from datetime import datetime
import json

class AutomatedResearch:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.results = []
 
 def market_analysis(self):
 # Automated market analysis
 topics = ["AI trends", "market developments", "competitor news"]
 for topic in topics:
 result = self.research_topic(topic)
 self.results.append(result)
 return self.results
 
 def research_topic(self, topic):
 # Your Perplexity API call here
 return {
 "topic": topic,
 "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
 "status": "completed"
 }
 
 def save_results(self):
 with open(f"research_results_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.json", "w") as f:
 json.dump(self.results, f)
```

**Try It Now**:
Implement the basic workflow structure

**Success Moment**:

## Skill Building (25 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Market Monitoring Workflow (8 minutes)
*Automate continuous market analysis*

**Your Mission**: Create an automated market monitoring system

**Copy This Code**:
```python
import schedule
import time
from datetime import datetime
import json
import requests

class MarketMonitor:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 
 def daily_market_scan(self):
 topics = [
 "latest AI industry developments",
 "market trends in technology",
 "startup funding news"
 ]
 
 results = []
 for topic in topics:
 result = self.research_topic(topic)
 results.append(result)
 
 self.save_daily_report(results)
 return results
 
 def research_topic(self, topic):
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": f"Research latest developments in: {topic}"}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 return {
 "topic": topic,
 "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
 "response": response.json()
 }
 
 def save_daily_report(self, results):
 filename = f"market_report_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.json"
 with open(filename, "w") as f:
 json.dump(results, f)
 
 def start_monitoring(self):
 schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(self.daily_market_scan)
 
 while True:
 schedule.run_pending()
 time.sleep(60)
```

**Try This Scenario**:
1. Set up the market monitor
2. Configure daily scanning
3. Test the automation

**Try It Now**:
1. Implement the code
2. Set up scheduling
3. Monitor the results

**Success Check**:
"Do you now have an automated market monitoring system? You just created what would take months to build!"

### Exercise 2: Competitor Analysis Workflow (8 minutes)
*Automate competitor intelligence gathering*

**Your Mission**: Create an automated competitor analysis system

**Copy This Code**:
```python
class CompetitorMonitor:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 self.competitors = ["Competitor A", "Competitor B", "Competitor C"]
 
 def weekly_competitor_analysis(self):
 results = []
 for competitor in self.competitors:
 analysis = self.analyze_competitor(competitor)
 results.append(analysis)
 
 self.save_competitor_report(results)
 return results
 
 def analyze_competitor(self, competitor):
 prompts = [
 f"Latest news about {competitor}",
 f"Recent product launches by {competitor}",
 f"Financial performance of {competitor}"
 ]
 
 analyses = []
 for prompt in prompts:
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 analyses.append(response.json())
 
 return {
 "competitor": competitor,
 "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
 "analyses": analyses
 }
 
 def save_competitor_report(self, results):
 filename = f"competitor_analysis_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.json"
 with open(filename, "w") as f:
 json.dump(results, f)
```

**Victory Moment**:
"You just created an automated competitor analysis system that runs weekly!"

### Exercise 3: Trend Analysis Workflow (9 minutes)

 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 
 def monthly_trend_analysis(self):
 industries = ["technology", "healthcare", "finance", "education"]
 trends = []
 
 for industry in industries:
 trend_data = self.analyze_industry_trends(industry)
 trends.append(trend_data)
 
 self.generate_trend_report(trends)
 return trends
 
 def analyze_industry_trends(self, industry):

## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "Workflows are running too frequently"
**Solution**: Adjust scheduling: "Set appropriate intervals for your research needs"

**Problem**: "Results are too generic"
**Solution**: Improve prompts: "Make prompts more specific to your industry"

**Problem**: "Automation is consuming too many API calls"
**Solution**: Optimize usage: "Cache results and implement rate limiting"

### Pro Tips for Workflow Automation:

1. **Start with simple workflows**: Begin with basic automation and add complexity
2. **Monitor performance**: Track workflow efficiency and costs
3. **Implement error handling**: Ensure workflows continue even if some calls fail
4. **Regular optimization**: Review and improve workflows based on results

### Power Workflow Automation Phrases:
- "Implement automated research workflows"
- "Set up continuous monitoring systems"
- "Create scheduled analysis reports"
- "Optimize API usage and costs"
