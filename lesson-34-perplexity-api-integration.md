## Quick Setup (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Get API Access (1 minute)
- Sign up for Perplexity API access
- Get your API keys and credentials
- Review the API documentation

### Step 2: The API Integration Test (2 minutes)

Let's test a simple API integration:

**Copy This Code**:
```python
import requests

def perplexity_search(query):
 url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 headers = {
 "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]
 }
 response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 return response.json()
```

**Try It Now**:
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key

**Success Moment**: 
"If you just successfully made an API call to Perplexity, you've discovered your integration superpower!"

## Skill Building (25 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Basic API Integration (8 minutes)
*Set up a simple research integration*

**Your Mission**: Create a basic research tool using Perplexity API

**Copy This Code**:
```python
import requests
import json

class PerplexityResearch:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 
 def research_topic(self, topic):
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": f"Research this topic: {topic}"}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 return response.json()
 
 def fact_check(self, claim):
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": f"Fact check this claim: {claim}"}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 return response.json()
```

**Try This Scenario**:
1. Set up the class with your API key
2. Test with a research topic
3. Test with a fact-checking request

**Try It Now**:
1. Implement the code
2. Test with different queries
3. Notice the structured responses

**Success Check**:
"Do you now have a working research tool powered by Perplexity? You just built what would take weeks to develop!"

### Exercise 2: Advanced API Features (8 minutes)
*Use advanced API capabilities for better results*

**Your Mission**: Implement advanced API features

**Copy This Code**:
```python
class AdvancedPerplexityResearch:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 
 def research_with_focus(self, topic, focus_mode="professional"):
 prompt = f"Research this topic with {focus_mode} focus: {topic}"
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
 "max_tokens": 1000,
 "temperature": 0.7
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 return response.json()
 
 def compare_topics(self, topic1, topic2):
 prompt = f"Compare and contrast these topics: {topic1} vs {topic2}"
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 return response.json()
```

**Victory Moment**:
"You just implemented advanced API features that provide more sophisticated research capabilities!"

### Exercise 3: Workflow Integration (9 minutes)
*Integrate Perplexity into existing workflows*

**Your Mission**: Create a workflow integration

**Copy This Code**:
```python
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

class WorkflowIntegration:
 def __init__(self, api_key):
 self.api_key = api_key
 self.base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
 self.headers = {
 "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
 "Content-Type": "application/json"
 }
 
 def automated_research(self, topic, output_format="summary"):
 prompt = f"Research {topic} and provide a {output_format}"
 data = {
 "model": "llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online",
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
 }
 response = requests.post(self.base_url, headers=self.headers, json=data)
 
 # Save results with timestamp
 result = {
 "topic": topic,
 "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
 "response": response.json(),
 "format": output_format
 }
 return result
 
 def batch_research(self, topics):
 results = []
 for topic in topics:
 result = self.automated_research(topic)
 results.append(result)
 return results
```

**expert Moment**:
"Congratulations. You just created a workflow integration that can automate research tasks!"

## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "API calls are failing"
**Solution**: Check authentication: "Verify your API key and permissions"

**Problem**: "Responses are too generic"
**Solution**: Improve prompts: "Make your prompts more specific and detailed"

**Problem**: "Rate limits are being hit"
**Solution**: Implement rate limiting: "Add delays between API calls"

### Pro Tips for API Integration:

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic functionality and add complexity
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling
3. **Cache results**: Store responses to avoid duplicate calls
4. **Monitor usage**: Track API usage to manage costs

### Power API Integration Phrases:
- "Implement proper error handling"
- "Add rate limiting and caching"
- "Use specific prompts for better results"
- "Monitor API usage and costs"
