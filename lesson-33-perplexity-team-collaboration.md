## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "Team members aren't contributing"
**Solution**: Create incentives: "Set up contribution recognition and rewards"

**Problem**: "Information is inconsistent"
