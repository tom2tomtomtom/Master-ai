# Lesson 7: Custom GPTs for Specialized Tasks

*Create your own AI assistants tailored to your specific workflows*

---

## The Problem Many professionals find

You've been using ChatGPT for a while, but you find yourself typing the same context over and over:
- "I'm a marketing manager at a B2B SaaS company..."
- "Please write in our brand voice which is professional but approachable..."
- "Remember our target audience is small business owners..."
- "Use our standard email format with..."

Every conversation starts with 5 minutes of setup. You're essentially training ChatGPT from scratch each time, and it doesn't remember your preferences, workflows, or company context.

What if you could create specialized AI assistants that already know your role, your company, your style, and your specific needs?

Today we're turning you into someone who has a team of custom AI assistants - each one perfectly trained for different aspects of your work.

**What You'll Save**: 1.5 hours per week on context setup and repetitive instructions 
**What You'll Gain**: Specialized AI assistants that work exactly how you need them
