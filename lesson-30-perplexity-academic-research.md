## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "The studies seem outdated"
**Solution**: Ask for recent research: "Focus on studies from the last 5 years"

**Problem**: "The language is too technical"
**Solution**: Request simplification: "Explain the findings in simple terms"

**Problem**: "I need more specific studies"
**Solution**: Be more specific: "Find studies specifically about [specific aspect]"

### Pro Tips for Academic Research:

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general topics, then focus on specific aspects
2. **Check publication dates**: Recent research is often more relevant
3. **Look for systematic reviews**: These provide comprehensive overviews
4. **Consider study quality**: Peer-reviewed journals are most credible

### Power Academic Research Phrases:
- "Find peer-reviewed studies on [topic]"
- "Compare findings from different studies"
- "Identify the most recent and relevant research"
- "Explain the practical implications of these findings"
