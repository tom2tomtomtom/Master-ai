# Lesson 15: Claude for Ethical Decision-Making & Risk Assessment

*Navigate complex ethical dilemmas and assess risks with principled reasoning*

---

## The Problem Many professionals find

Ethical decisions keep you up at night:
- You face complex situations with no clear "right" answer
- Business pressures conflict with ethical considerations
- You worry about unintended consequences of your decisions
- Risk assessment feels like guesswork instead of systematic analysis
- You need to balance multiple stakeholder interests and values

Most people either avoid difficult ethical decisions or make them based on gut feeling without systematic analysis.

Claude transforms this completely. It's like having a wise ethics advisor who can help you think through complex moral and risk considerations systematically.

### Step 2: The Ethical Reasoning Test (2.5 minutes)

Let's prove Claude's ethical reasoning power with a complex scenario:

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
Help me think through this ethical dilemma systematically:

Please help me analyze:
1. Ethical considerations from different perspectives
2. Stakeholder impacts and interests
3. Potential consequences of different actions
4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
5. Recommended approach with ethical reasoning

Consider multiple ethical frameworks and practical implications.

## Skill Building (20 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Stakeholder Impact Analysis (7 minutes)
*Understand how decisions affect different groups and their interests*

**Your Mission**: Analyze a complex decision from all stakeholder perspectives

**The Old Way**(Don't do this):
- Focus only on obvious stakeholders and immediate impacts
- Make decisions based on who has the most power or influence
- Ignore long-term consequences and indirect effects
- Let urgency override thorough ethical consideration
- Time Required: Quick decisions that create long-term problems
- Outcome: Unintended consequences, damaged relationships, regret**The AI Way**(Do this instead):**Copy This Prompt**:
```
Help me analyze this decision from all stakeholder perspectives:

DECISION CONTEXT: [DESCRIBE YOUR SITUATION]

PROPOSED ACTION: [WHAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING DOING]

Please provide:
1. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
 - Primary stakeholders (directly affected)
 - Secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected)
 - Often-overlooked groups who might be impacted

2. IMPACT ANALYSIS
 - How each stakeholder group would be affected
 - Short-term vs. long-term consequences
 - Positive and negative impacts for each group

3. STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS
 - What each group values and prioritizes
 - Potential conflicts between different interests
 - Areas of alignment and mutual benefit

4. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 - Rights and responsibilities involved
 - Fairness and justice implications
 - Potential for harm or benefit

5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
 - Options that better balance stakeholder interests
 - Creative solutions that address multiple concerns
 - Compromise positions that minimize harm

6. DECISION FRAMEWORK
 - How to weigh competing interests
 - Criteria for making the final decision
 - Process for stakeholder engagement
```

**Try This Scenario**:
```
Decision: Implementing AI automation that will eliminate 20 jobs but save $500K annually
Context: Manufacturing company, 200 employees, competitive pressure
Stakeholders: Affected employees, remaining staff, shareholders, customers, community

**Success Check**:
"Do you now see impacts you hadn't considered? Are there creative solutions that better balance interests? You just gained stakeholder analysis superpowers!"

### Exercise 2: Risk Assessment & Mitigation (7 minutes)
*Systematically evaluate and prepare for potential risks*

**Your Mission**: Assess risks comprehensively and develop mitigation strategies

**Copy This Prompt**:
```

SITUATION/DECISION: [WHAT YOU'RE EVALUATING]

CONTEXT:

 - Risk priority matrix (probability Ã— impact)
 - Interconnected risks that could cascade

3. MITIGATION STRATEGIES
 - Prevention measures (how to reduce probability)
 - Impact reduction (how to minimize consequences)
 - Contingency plans (what to do if risks occur)
 - Early warning indicators (how to detect problems early)

4. RISK MONITORING
 - Key metrics to track
 - Review schedule and triggers
 - Decision points for changing approach

5. RESIDUAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### Exercise 3: Ethical Framework Application (6 minutes)
*Apply established ethical principles to complex business decisions*

**Your Mission**: Use multiple ethical frameworks to evaluate a difficult decision

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
Help me evaluate this decision using multiple ethical frameworks:

DECISION SCENARIO: [DESCRIBE YOUR ETHICAL DILEMMA]

CONTEXT:
- Key stakeholders: [WHO'S INVOLVED]
- Competing values: [WHAT VALUES ARE IN TENSION]
- Constraints: [WHAT LIMITS YOUR OPTIONS]
- Urgency: [HOW QUICKLY YOU MUST DECIDE]

Please analyze using these ethical frameworks:

1. CONSEQUENTIALIST ANALYSIS (Outcomes-based)
 - What are the likely consequences of each option?
 - Which choice produces the best overall outcomes?
 - How do we weigh benefits against harms?

2. DEONTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (Duty-based)
 - What duties and obligations are involved?
 - Are there universal principles that apply?
 - Which actions respect human dignity and rights?

3. VIRTUE ETHICS ANALYSIS (Character-based)
 - What would a person of good character do?
 - Which choice reflects virtues like honesty, courage, justice?
 - What kind of organization do we want to be?

4. CARE ETHICS ANALYSIS (Relationship-based)
 - How do different choices affect relationships?
 - What shows care and concern for those affected?
 - How do we maintain trust and connection?

5. JUSTICE ANALYSIS (Fairness-based)
 - Which option is most fair to all parties?
 - How do we balance competing claims and needs?
 - What does equal treatment look like here?

6. SYNTHESIS AND RECOMMENDATION
 - Where do the frameworks agree/disagree?
 - Which considerations are most important in this context?
 - Recommended approach with ethical justification
```

**Try This Dilemma**:
```
Scenario: Employee reports harassment by top-performing manager
Context: Manager generates 30% of company revenue, accuser is newer employee
Values: Employee safety vs. business continuity, truth vs. reputation
Options: Immediate termination, investigation, mediation, transfer
Urgency: Other employees are watching how leadership responds
```

**expert Moment**:
"Congratulations. You just applied multiple ethical frameworks to a complex dilemma. This systematic approach ensures you consider all moral dimensions and make principled decisions you can defend."
