## Skill Building (35 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Multi-Model AI Orchestra (12 minutes)
*Coordinate multiple AI models for complex document processing*

**Objective**: Build system that uses best AI model for each task

**Architecture Design**:
```
Document Intelligence Pipeline:

Entry Point:
- Webhook receives document
- Extract metadata
- Determine document type

AI Model Selection:
IF: Legal document
  → Claude (best for legal analysis)
  → Extract: clauses, risks, obligations
  
ELIF: Technical documentation
  → ChatGPT with code interpreter
  → Extract: code samples, architecture
  
ELIF: Financial report
  → Custom GPT-4 with plugins
  → Extract: metrics, trends, anomalies
  
ELIF: Image-heavy document
  → Google Vision API first
  → Then appropriate text model

Processing Pipeline:
1. Document parsing (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
2. Chunking for context windows
3. Parallel processing of chunks
4. Result aggregation
5. Quality validation
6. Structured data output

Error Handling:
- Retry failed chunks
- Fallback models
- Human review queue
- Confidence scoring
```

**Implementation with Code Nodes**:
```javascript
// Custom function for model selection
const documentType = $input.first().json.documentType;
const modelConfig = {
  'legal': {
    model: 'claude-3',
    temperature: 0.2,
    systemPrompt: 'You are a legal analysis expert...'
  },
  'technical': {
    model: 'gpt-4',
    temperature: 0.3,
    systemPrompt: 'You are a technical documentation expert...'
  },
  'financial': {
    model: 'gpt-4-turbo',
    temperature: 0.1,
    systemPrompt: 'You are a financial analyst...'
  }
};

return modelConfig[documentType] || modelConfig['technical'];
```

**Advanced Features**:
- Parallel chunk processing
- Result caching
- Incremental updates
- Version comparison

### Exercise 2: Real-Time AI Data Pipeline (12 minutes)
*Build streaming data processor with AI enrichment*

**Objective**: Process real-time data streams with AI analysis

**System Architecture**:
```
Real-Time Intelligence System:

Data Sources:
- Webhook endpoints
- Database triggers
- Message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- WebSocket connections
- API polling

Stream Processing:
1. Data Ingestion
   - Validate schema
   - Deduplicate
   - Buffer if needed

2. AI Enrichment Layer
   Parallel Processing:
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Entity extraction
   - Anomaly detection
   - Trend identification
   - Predictive scoring

3. Decision Engine
   Rules-based routing:
   IF anomaly_score > 0.8:
     → Immediate alert
     → Detailed AI analysis
     → Execute response
   
   ELIF trend_change > threshold:
     → Update dashboards
     → Notify stakeholders
     → Adjust parameters

4. Output Destinations
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Database updates
   - Webhook notifications
   - Email/Slack alerts
```

**Code Node for Stream Processing**:
```javascript
// Buffer and batch for efficiency
const batchSize = 10;
const timeout = 5000;

const items = $input.all();
const batches = [];

for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += batchSize) {
  batches.push(items.slice(i, i + batchSize));
}

// Process batches with AI
const results = [];
for (const batch of batches) {
  const enriched = await processWithAI(batch);
  results.push(...enriched);
}

async function processWithAI(batch) {
  // Parallel AI processing
  const promises = batch.map(item => ({
    sentiment: analyzeSentiment(item),
    entities: extractEntities(item),
    anomaly: detectAnomaly(item)
  }));
  
  return Promise.all(promises);
}
```

### Exercise 3: Self-Learning Automation System (11 minutes)
*Create workflows that improve themselves using AI*

**Objective**: Build system that learns from outcomes and optimizes

**Self-Improving Architecture**:
```
Adaptive AI Automation:

Learning Loop:
1. Execute automation
2. Capture outcomes
3. AI analyzes performance
4. Suggest improvements
5. Test variations
6. Deploy best performer

Components:

Performance Tracking:
- Success/failure rates
- Processing times
- Resource usage
- Output quality scores
- User feedback

AI Analysis Engine:
Every 100 executions:
- Pattern recognition
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization suggestions
- A/B test proposals

Continuous Improvement:
- Prompt refinement
- Workflow path optimization
- Model selection tuning
- Threshold adjustments

Implementation Example:
Customer Support Classifier that learns:

Initial State:
- Basic category detection
- 70% accuracy

Learning Process:
1. Log all classifications
2. Track correction rate
3. Weekly AI analysis:
   - Misclassification patterns
   - Common corrections
   - Edge cases

4. Generate improvements:
   - Refined prompts
   - New categories
   - Better examples

5. A/B test changes
6. Deploy winners

After 3 months:
- 95% accuracy
- 50% faster processing
- New categories discovered
```

**Feedback Loop Code**:
```javascript
// Store performance metrics
const performance = {
  execution_id: $executionId,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  input_type: $input.first().json.type,
  processing_time: $execution.duration,
  output_quality: calculateQuality($output),
  user_feedback: null // Updated later
};

// Every 100 executions, analyze
if (executionCount % 100 === 0) {
  const improvements = await analyzePerformance();
  await testImprovements(improvements);
}
```

## Advanced n8n Techniques

### Custom AI Integrations

**Building Custom Nodes**:
```javascript
// Custom AI model integration
class CustomAINode implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'Custom AI Model',
    name: 'customAI',
    group: ['transform'],
    version: 1,
    description: 'Custom AI model integration',
    defaults: {
      name: 'Custom AI',
    },
    inputs: ['main'],
    outputs: ['main'],
    properties: [
      // Node properties
    ],
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // Custom logic here
  }
}
```

### Workflow Templates

**Complex Workflow Patterns**:

**1. Scatter-Gather Pattern**:
```
Split → Multiple AI Models → Aggregate → Best Result
```

**2. Pipeline Pattern**:
```
Extract → Transform → Analyze → Load
```

**3. Competing Consumers**:
```
Queue → Multiple Workers → First Complete Wins
```

### Performance Optimization
