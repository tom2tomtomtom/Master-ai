# 📊 **MASTER-AI CURRICULUM REVISION TRACKER**

## **REVISION PRIORITIES**

### **🚨 CRITICAL - Fix First (Day 2)**
Lessons with most egregious hype that hurt credibility:

| Lesson | Current Issue | Fix Required | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 01 | "Email ninja", excessive exclamations | Professional tone, realistic metrics | ⏳ |
| 02 | "Revolutionary", unrealistic time saves | Measured claims, add limitations | ⏳ |
| 10 | "Transform your research" hyperbole | Specific capabilities, real examples | ⏳ |
| 37 | "Breathtaking visuals" oversell | Technical capabilities focus | ⏳ |
| 40 | "World's most advanced" claim | Balanced comparison, pros/cons | ⏳ |
| 52 | "AI agents will change everything" | Realistic automation scope | ⏳ |
| 78 | Surface-level change management | Add organizational complexity | ✅ |
| 79 | Checklist-style security | Add technical depth, architecture | ✅ |
| 80 | Pure celebration, no substance | Add integration patterns | ⏳ |

### **⚠️ MODERATE - Enhance (Day 3)**
Lessons needing depth and realism:

| Lesson Range | Issue | Enhancement Needed |
|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| 20-30 (Gemini) | Good structure, but generic | Add Google-specific integrations |
| 31-36 (Perplexity) | Too brief | Expand research methodologies |
| 45-48 (Visual Business) | Lacks enterprise context | Add brand guidelines, compliance |
| 55-65 (Business Tools) | Missing integration details | Add IT architecture, security |

### **✅ MINOR - Polish (Day 4)**
Good lessons needing only tone adjustment:

| Lesson Range | Current State | Minor Fixes |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 11-18 (Claude) | Well-structured, bit hypey | Tone down superlatives |
| 41-44 (Stable Diffusion) | Technical, but some hype | Adjust marketing language |
| 66-70 (Enterprise) | Good depth, excessive enthusiasm | Professional tone |
