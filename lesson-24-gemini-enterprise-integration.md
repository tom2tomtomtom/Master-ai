## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "Users aren't adopting the AI tools"
**Solution**: Start with high-impact, low-effort use cases and provide hands-on training

**Problem**: "Security team is blocking implementation"
**Solution**: Create a pilot program with strict controls and demonstrate value

**Problem**: "Costs are higher than expected"
**Solution**: Start with targeted deployment and scale based on usage and ROI

### Pro Tips for Enterprise Integration:

1. **Start small**: Begin with a pilot group and expand based on success
2. **Measure everything**: Track usage, productivity gains, and user satisfaction
3. **Train champions**: Identify power users who can help others
4. **Iterate quickly**: Gather feedback and adjust your approach

### Power Enterprise Phrases:
- "Create a phased rollout plan"
- "Include security and compliance controls"
- "Design training for different user types"
- "Set up monitoring and governance"
