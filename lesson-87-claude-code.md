# Lesson 87: Claude Code - Your AI Terminal Companion for Deep Coding

*Transform terminal velocity coding with Claude's deep codebase understanding and agentic capabilities*

---

## The Challenge

Modern development workflows suffer from constant context switching:
- Jumping between terminal, IDE, and documentation
- Manually navigating large codebases
- Repetitive refactoring across multiple files
- Debugging without full project context
- Writing boilerplate code and tests

Claude Code eliminates these friction points by embedding Claude directly in your terminal - understanding your entire codebase, executing commands, and handling complex multi-file edits through natural conversation.

**What You'll Save**: 15+ hours per week on coding tasks
**What You'll Gain**: Deep codebase awareness + multi-file editing + automated workflows
**What You'll Need**: Node.js 18+ and an Anthropic API key

## Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Installation (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Step 2: First Interaction (8 minutes)

**Basic Code Understanding**:
```bash
# In Claude Code REPL
> Explain the architecture of this project

# Claude analyzes your entire codebase and provides:
# - Project structure overview
# - Key components and their relationships
# - Technology stack analysis
# - Design patterns used
```

**Your First Code Generation**:
```bash
> Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication with JWT
# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze your existing code structure
# 2. Create the endpoint following your patterns
# 3. Add necessary dependencies
# 4. Generate tests
# 5. Update documentation
```

**Success Indicator**: 
Claude creates working code that follows your project's conventions without manual configuration

## Core Features & Commands

### Terminal-First Design
```bash
# Start with initial prompt
claude "Fix the memory leak in the WebSocket handler"

# Continue previous conversation
claude -c

# Resume specific session
claude -r "session-id" "Continue implementing the feature"

# Non-interactive mode (print and exit)
claude -p "Explain this error" < error.log

# Pipe support
git diff | claude -p "Review these changes for potential issues"
```

### Deep Codebase Understanding
```bash
> Analyze the data flow between the auth service and user service

> Find all places where we're not properly handling errors

> What are the performance bottlenecks in this codebase?

> Show me examples of how we typically handle pagination
```

### Multi-File Editing Power
```bash
> Refactor all API endpoints to use the new error handling middleware

> Update all test files to use the new testing utilities

> Migrate from callbacks to async/await across the entire project

> Add TypeScript types to all JavaScript files in the src directory
```

## Skill Building (40 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Feature Development Workflow (15 minutes)
*Build complete features with comprehensive implementation*

**Objective**: Implement a full feature from description to deployment

**Feature Implementation**:
```bash
> Implement a rate limiting system for our API with the following requirements:
  - Redis-based storage
  - Configurable limits per endpoint
  - Bypass for authenticated admin users
  - Prometheus metrics integration
  - Comprehensive error messages
  - Full test coverage

# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze your current middleware structure
# 2. Create rate limiting middleware
# 3. Set up Redis configuration
# 4. Implement admin bypass logic
# 5. Add Prometheus metrics
# 6. Generate unit and integration tests
# 7. Update API documentation
# 8. Create migration guide
```

**Advanced Pattern Detection**:
```bash
> Our codebase has inconsistent error handling. Create a unified error handling strategy and implement it everywhere

# Claude analyzes patterns and:
# - Identifies all error handling approaches
# - Proposes unified strategy
# - Creates base error classes
# - Refactors all endpoints
# - Updates tests
# - Documents the new pattern
```

### Exercise 2: Intelligent Debugging (12 minutes)
*Solve complex bugs with full context awareness*

**Objective**: Debug production issues efficiently

**Memory Leak Investigation**:
```bash
> We're seeing memory usage grow over time in production. Here's the heap dump analysis: [paste data]. Find and fix the leak.

# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze heap dump data
# 2. Identify potential leak sources
# 3. Trace through related code
# 4. Propose specific fixes
# 5. Add memory leak tests
```

**Performance Optimization**:
```bash
> Our API response times have degraded 40% over the last month. Profile the codebase and optimize the slowest endpoints.

# Claude's approach:
# - Analyze database queries
# - Check for N+1 problems
# - Review caching strategy
# - Optimize algorithms
# - Add performance tests
# - Create monitoring alerts
```

### Exercise 3: Code Migration & Modernization (13 minutes)
*Transform legacy code with intelligence*

**Objective**: Modernize codebases systematically

**Framework Migration**:
```bash
> Migrate our Express.js application to Fastify while maintaining all functionality

# Claude handles:
# 1. Dependency analysis
# 2. Route conversion
# 3. Middleware adaptation
# 4. Plugin migration
# 5. Test updates
# 6. Performance comparison
# 7. Rollback plan
```

**Monolith to Microservices**:
```bash
> Extract the authentication module into a separate microservice

# Step-by-step execution:
# - Identify all dependencies
# - Create service boundaries
# - Implement API contracts
# - Set up inter-service communication
# - Handle data consistency
# - Create deployment configs
# - Document the architecture
```

## Advanced Claude Code Techniques

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

**Connecting External Tools**:
```bash
# Add GitHub integration
claude mcp add github /path/to/github-mcp-server

# Add Jira integration  
claude mcp add jira-server --transport sse https://jira-mcp.company.com

# Project-level MCP configuration (.mcp.json)
{
  "servers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/postgres-mcp",
      "args": ["--connection-string", "${POSTGRES_URL}"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Using MCP Tools**:
```bash
> Check our GitHub issues and create fixes for the critical bugs

> Query the production database for users affected by the recent bug

> Update the Jira tickets for completed features
```

### Memory Management (CLAUDE.md)

**Project-Specific Instructions**:
```markdown
<!-- CLAUDE.md in project root -->
# Project Context

## Architecture Decisions
- We use Domain-Driven Design with clear boundaries
- All async operations use async/await (no callbacks)
- Error handling follows the Result pattern

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- 100% test coverage requirement
- Comments only for complex algorithms

## Common Patterns
- Use dependency injection for services
- Repository pattern for data access
- Event sourcing for audit trails
```

### Workflow Automation

**CI/CD Integration**:
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:ai": "claude -p 'Review for code smells and suggest improvements'",
    "test:generate": "claude -p 'Generate tests for any untested functions'",
    "docs:update": "claude -p 'Update API documentation based on code changes'"
  }
}
```

**Git Hooks**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
changes=$(git diff --cached)
echo "$changes" | claude -p "Review these changes. Exit with 1 if there are critical issues" || exit 1
```

## Power User Features

### Unix Philosophy Integration
```bash
# Stream log analysis
tail -f app.log | claude -p "Alert me if you see any security anomalies"

# Batch processing
find . -name "*.test.js" | xargs claude -p "Modernize these test files to use Jest v29"

# Pipeline composition
git log --oneline -10 | claude -p "Summarize recent changes for the changelog"
```

### Performance Mode
```bash
# Skip confirmation prompts for trusted operations
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Clear context between tasks
/clear

# Output formatting
claude -p "Generate API types" --output-format json

# Streaming responses
claude -p "Analyze codebase" --output-format stream-json
```

### Session Management
```bash
# List all sessions
/sessions

# Switch between projects quickly
claude --continue  # Resume last session

# Save session for later
/save "Feature X Implementation"
```

## Best Practices & Tips

### Effective Prompting
1. **Be Specific**: "Add error handling" → "Add try-catch blocks with structured logging and user-friendly error messages"
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant constraints, standards, or examples
3. **Iterate**: Use Claude's corrections to refine solutions
4. **Chunk Work**: Break large tasks into focused requests

### Safety & Security
```bash
# Use containers for untrusted operations
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace claude-code

# Restrict file access
claude --allowed-paths ./src,./tests

# Review before executing
claude --permission-mode review
```

### Team Collaboration
1. **Shared Memory**: Check in `.CLAUDE.md` files
2. **MCP Configs**: Share `.mcp.json` for tool access
3. **Standards**: Document team conventions
4. **Scripts**: Create reusable Claude commands
