## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "The app design is too complex"
**Solution**: Start with a simple MVP and iterate: "Create a basic version first"

**Problem**: "I don't know how to implement it"
**Solution**: Ask for step-by-step instructions: "Provide detailed implementation steps"

**Problem**: "The output quality isn't good enough"
**Solution**: Add quality controls: "Include validation and review steps"

### Pro Tips for Custom Applications:

1. **Start simple**: Build a basic version and improve over time
2. **Focus on value**: Automate high-impact, repetitive tasks first
3. **Test thoroughly**: Always validate outputs before full deployment
4. **Document everything**: Keep track of how your apps work

### Power App-Building Phrases:
- "Create a simple MVP first"
- "Include error handling and validation"
- "Design for scalability and maintenance"
- "Provide clear usage instructions"
