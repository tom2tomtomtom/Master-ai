### Step 2: The Complex Problem Test (2 minutes)

Let's prove this works with a real business scenario:

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I need to solve this complex business problem:

[PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]

Please help me:
1. Break down the problem into its core components
2. Analyze each component systematically

6. Recommend the best approach with reasoning

Use structured thinking and consider multiple perspectives.
```

**Try It Now**:
Replace [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION] with: "Our SaaS product has 40% customer churn rate, but our competitor analysis shows we have better features. Our customer support team says users find the interface confusing, but our UX team insists the design is intuitive."

## Skill Building (25 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Strategic Decision Framework (8 minutes)
*Make complex decisions with confidence*

**Your Mission**: Evaluate a major business investment decision

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I need to make a strategic decision about [DECISION TOPIC]. Here's the context:

[BACKGROUND INFORMATION]

Please help me:
1. Identify the key decision criteria
2. List all relevant options
3. Analyze each option against the criteria
4. Consider risks and uncertainties
5. Provide a recommendation with clear reasoning
6. Suggest implementation steps

Use a structured decision-making framework.
```

**Try This Scenario**:
Replace [DECISION TOPIC] with: "whether to expand into a new market segment"
Replace [BACKGROUND INFORMATION] with: "We're a B2B software company with $2M ARR. We're considering expanding from small businesses to enterprise customers. This would require hiring 3 salespeople, developing enterprise features, and changing our pricing model. Our current market is saturated, but enterprise sales cycles are longer and more complex."

**Try It Now**:
1. Customize and run the prompt
2. Notice how Gemini structures the analysis
3. Look for insights you hadn't considered

**Success Check**:
"Do you now have a clear decision framework with pros/cons for each option? You just completed what would be a week-long strategic planning session!"

### Exercise 2: Root Cause Analysis (8 minutes)
*Find the real problem, not just the symptoms*

**Your Mission**: Solve a recurring business problem

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I'm dealing with a recurring problem: [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]

I've tried these solutions but they haven't worked:
[PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS]

Please help me:
1. Identify the root causes (not just symptoms)
2. Use the "5 Whys" technique to dig deeper
3. Map out the cause-and-effect relationships
4. Suggest solutions that address root causes
5. Create an action plan to implement the solution

Focus on systemic issues rather than quick fixes.
```

**Try This Scenario**:
Replace [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION] with: "Our team consistently misses project deadlines"
Replace [PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS] with: "We've tried setting stricter deadlines, adding more team members, and using project management software, but the problem persists."

**Victory Moment**: 
"You just identified the real issues behind your problem instead of treating symptoms. This level of analysis usually requires expensive consultants!"

### Exercise 3: Multi-Perspective Analysis (9 minutes)
*Consider all stakeholders and viewpoints*

**Your Mission**: Resolve a conflict between different departments

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I need to resolve a conflict between different stakeholders:

[CONFLICT DESCRIPTION]

Please help me:
1. Identify each stakeholder's perspective and interests
2. Map out the underlying concerns and motivations
3. Find common ground and shared objectives
4. Generate solutions that address everyone's needs
5. Create a communication plan to present the solution
6. Suggest implementation steps that build consensus

Use empathy and systems thinking to find win-win solutions.
```

**Try This Scenario**:
Replace [CONFLICT DESCRIPTION] with: "Marketing wants to launch a new product feature immediately to capitalize on a trend, but Engineering says they need 3 months to build it properly. Sales is pressuring both teams because they've already promised it to customers."

**expert Moment**:
"Congratulations. You just facilitated what could have been a months-long conflict resolution process in minutes. You're now the person who brings teams together!"

## Limitations & Considerations

### When NOT to Use This Approach
- Highly sensitive or confidential data
- Tasks requiring 100% accuracy without review 
- Situations where human judgment is critical
- When cost scales beyond budget

### Privacy & Security Notes
- Review your organization's AI usage policies
- Never input proprietary or sensitive information
- Consider data retention policies of AI providers

## Troubleshooting & Pro Tips (3 minutes)

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "The analysis is too generic"
**Solution**: Add specific details: "Consider our company's specific context: [details]"

**Problem**: "I need more actionable steps"
**Solution**: Ask: "Break down the implementation into specific, time-bound steps"

**Problem**: "The solution doesn't consider risks"
**Solution**: Add: "Include a risk assessment and mitigation strategies"

### Pro Tips for Advanced Reasoning:

1. **Start with context**: Always provide relevant background information
2. **Ask for frameworks**: "Use [specific framework] to analyze this"
3. **Request multiple perspectives**: "Consider this from [different viewpoints]"
4. **Follow up systematically**: Build on previous responses with deeper questions

### Power Reasoning Phrases:
- "Use systems thinking to analyze this"
- "Consider both short-term and long-term implications"
- "What are the unintended consequences?"
- "How would this look from [stakeholder] perspective?"
