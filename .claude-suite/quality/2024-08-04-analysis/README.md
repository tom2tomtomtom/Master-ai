2. Compare new report to @analysis-report.md baseline
3. Update @progress.md metrics and goals
4. Adjust priorities based on new findings
5. Share progress with team/stakeholders
```

```bash
# Daily quality check
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# Progress tracking
grep -r "console\." src/ | wc -l    # Console count
grep -r ": any" src/ | wc -l        # Any types count
npm test -- --coverage              # Test coverage
```
