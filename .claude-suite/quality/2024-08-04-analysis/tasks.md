  - [ ] 6.3 Refactor dashboard/page.tsx (500+ lines) into modular sections
    - Split: DashboardHeader, StatsSection, PathsGrid, RecentActivity
  - [ ] 6.4 Extract common patterns into reusable hooks
  - [ ] 6.5 Add React.memo for performance-critical components
  - [ ] 6.6 Verify all components render correctly after refactoring

- [ ] 7. Database Query Optimization
