*Solve multi-step business challenges with AI that thinks step-by-step*

---

## The Problem Many professionals find

You know that moment when your boss drops a complex problem on your desk and says "figure this out"? Maybe it's:
- "Why are our sales down 15% and what should we do about it?"
- "Should we expand to the European market next year?"
- "How do we reduce customer churn while maintaining profitability?"

These aren't Google-able questions. They require deep thinking, multiple perspectives, and connecting dots across different areas. You end up with:
- Hours of analysis paralysis
- Spreadsheets that don't tell the whole story
- Recommendations you're not confident about
- The nagging feeling you missed something important

Today we're introducing you to ChatGPT o1 - the reasoning model that thinks through complex problems step-by-step like your smartest colleague.

**What You'll Save**: 4 hours per week on complex analysis 
**What You'll Gain**: Confidence in tackling any business challenge + reputation as a strategic thinker

## Skill Building (20 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Strategic Decision Analysis (7 minutes)
*Make better decisions with systematic reasoning*

**Your Mission**: Decide whether to launch a new product line

**The Old Way**(Don't do this):
- Make pro/con lists that miss important factors
- Rely on gut feeling without systematic analysis
- Focus on obvious factors, miss hidden risks
- Make decisions without considering implementation challenges
- Time Required: Days of back-and-forth discussion
- Confidence Level: Low (too many unknowns)**The AI Way**(Do this instead):**Copy This Prompt**:
```
Help me make a strategic decision about [DECISION]. Please think through this systematically:

1. Frame the decision clearly with key criteria for success
2. Identify all stakeholders and their interests
3. Analyze potential outcomes and their probabilities
4. Consider implementation challenges and resource requirements
5. Evaluate risks and mitigation strategies
6. Provide a structured recommendation with reasoning

Context: [PROVIDE YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION]
Timeline: [WHEN DECISION IS NEEDED]
Constraints: [BUDGET, RESOURCES, OTHER LIMITATIONS]
```

**Customize It**:
- [DECISION]: "launching a premium version of our software product"
- [CONTEXT]: "SaaS company with 10,000 users, considering 40% price increase for premium features"
- [TIMELINE]: "need to decide by end of quarter"
- [CONSTRAINTS]: "limited development resources, competitive market"

**Try It Now**:
1. Paste the customized prompt into o1
2. Watch it systematically work through each aspect
3. Notice how it considers factors you might have missed

**Success Check**:
"Did o1 identify risks and opportunities you hadn't considered? Does the reasoning feel thorough and logical? You just got strategic consulting-level analysis!"

### Exercise 2: Root Cause Analysis (7 minutes)
*Get to the real source of problems, not just symptoms*

**Your Mission**: Figure out why a key project is behind schedule

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I need to conduct a root cause analysis for this problem:
[DESCRIBE YOUR PROBLEM IN DETAIL]

Please use systematic reasoning to:
1. Distinguish between symptoms and root causes
2. Apply the "5 Whys" technique to dig deeper
3. Consider multiple potential root causes (people, process, technology, external)
4. Evaluate which root causes are most likely and impactful
5. Suggest targeted solutions for each root cause
6. Prioritize solutions by impact and feasibility

Be thorough but practical - I need actionable insights.
```

**Try This Scenario**:
```
Our software development project is 3 weeks behind schedule. The team says 
they're working hard, but velocity has dropped 30% over the last month. 
Stakeholders are frustrated with missed deadlines. Team morale seems low. 
We've had some turnover recently and requirements have changed twice.
```

**Try It Now**:
1. Paste the scenario into the prompt
2. Watch o1 systematically analyze the situation
3. Notice how it separates symptoms from root causes

**Victory Moment**: 
"You just got a professional-level root cause analysis that would normally require a consultant or extensive team workshops. o1 helped you see the forest, not just the trees!"

### Exercise 3: Market Opportunity Assessment (6 minutes)
*Evaluate new opportunities with strategic rigor*

**Your Mission**: Assess whether to enter a new market segment

**Copy This Prompt**:
```
I'm considering entering a new market opportunity. Please provide a systematic 
assessment using strategic frameworks:

Opportunity: [DESCRIBE THE MARKET/PRODUCT OPPORTUNITY]
Our Company: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS]

Please analyze:
1. Market attractiveness (size, growth, profitability potential)
2. Competitive landscape and our competitive advantages
3. Required capabilities vs. our current strengths
4. Resource requirements and investment needed
5. Risk factors and potential barriers to entry
6. Strategic fit with our current business
7. Recommendation with implementation approach

Use frameworks like Porter's Five Forces where relevant.
```

**Test Scenario**:
- [OPPORTUNITY]: "AI-powered customer service chatbots for small businesses"
- [OUR COMPANY]: "Web development agency with 25 employees, strong in custom software"

**expert Moment**:
"Congratulations. You just conducted a strategic market assessment that would normally require weeks of research and analysis. You're thinking like a strategy consultant!"
