```javascript
// Select problematic code
// Cmd+K: "Why is this causing a memory leak?"

// Cursor explains:
// "The event listener in useEffect is not being cleaned up.
// The closure is holding references to old state values."

// Then provides fix:
useEffect(() => {
  const handler = (e) => handleEvent(e);
  window.addEventListener(''resize'', handler);
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener(''resize'', handler);
  };
}, [handleEvent]);

  '# Lesson 87: Claude Code - Your AI Terminal Companion for Deep Coding

*Transform terminal velocity coding with Claude''s deep codebase understanding and agentic capabilities*

---

## The Challenge

Modern development workflows suffer from constant context switching:
- Jumping between terminal, IDE, and documentation
- Manually navigating large codebases
- Repetitive refactoring across multiple files
- Debugging without full project context
- Writing boilerplate code and tests

Claude Code eliminates these friction points by embedding Claude directly in your terminal - understanding your entire codebase, executing commands, and handling complex multi-file edits through natural conversation.

**What You''ll Save**: 15+ hours per week on coding tasks
**What You''ll Gain**: Deep codebase awareness + multi-file editing + automated workflows
**What You''ll Need**: Node.js 18+ and an Anthropic API key

---

## Quick Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Installation (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=''your-api-key-here''

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Step 2: First Interaction (8 minutes)

**Basic Code Understanding**:
```bash
# In Claude Code REPL
> Explain the architecture of this project

# Claude analyzes your entire codebase and provides:
# - Project structure overview
# - Key components and their relationships
# - Technology stack analysis
# - Design patterns used
```

**Your First Code Generation**:
```bash
> Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication with JWT
# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze your existing code structure
# 2. Create the endpoint following your patterns
# 3. Add necessary dependencies
# 4. Generate tests
# 5. Update documentation
```

**Success Indicator**: 
Claude creates working code that follows your project''s conventions without manual configuration

## Core Features & Commands

### Terminal-First Design
```bash
# Start with initial prompt
claude "Fix the memory leak in the WebSocket handler"

# Continue previous conversation
claude -c

# Resume specific session
claude -r "session-id" "Continue implementing the feature"

# Non-interactive mode (print and exit)
claude -p "Explain this error" < error.log

# Pipe support
git diff | claude -p "Review these changes for potential issues"
```

### Deep Codebase Understanding
```bash
> Analyze the data flow between the auth service and user service

> Find all places where we''re not properly handling errors

> What are the performance bottlenecks in this codebase?

> Show me examples of how we typically handle pagination
```

### Multi-File Editing Power
```bash
> Refactor all API endpoints to use the new error handling middleware

> Update all test files to use the new testing utilities

> Migrate from callbacks to async/await across the entire project

> Add TypeScript types to all JavaScript files in the src directory
```

## Skill Building (40 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Feature Development Workflow (15 minutes)
*Build complete features with comprehensive implementation*

**Objective**: Implement a full feature from description to deployment

**Feature Implementation**:
```bash
> Implement a rate limiting system for our API with the following requirements:
  - Redis-based storage
  - Configurable limits per endpoint
  - Bypass for authenticated admin users
  - Prometheus metrics integration
  - Comprehensive error messages
  - Full test coverage

# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze your current middleware structure
# 2. Create rate limiting middleware
# 3. Set up Redis configuration
# 4. Implement admin bypass logic
# 5. Add Prometheus metrics
# 6. Generate unit and integration tests
# 7. Update API documentation
# 8. Create migration guide
```

**Advanced Pattern Detection**:
```bash
> Our codebase has inconsistent error handling. Create a unified error handling strategy and implement it everywhere

# Claude analyzes patterns and:
# - Identifies all error handling approaches
# - Proposes unified strategy
# - Creates base error classes
# - Refactors all endpoints
# - Updates tests
# - Documents the new pattern
```

### Exercise 2: Intelligent Debugging (12 minutes)
*Solve complex bugs with full context awareness*

**Objective**: Debug production issues efficiently

**Memory Leak Investigation**:
```bash
> We''re seeing memory usage grow over time in production. Here''s the heap dump analysis: [paste data]. Find and fix the leak.

# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze heap dump data
# 2. Identify potential leak sources
# 3. Trace through related code
# 4. Propose specific fixes
# 5. Add memory leak tests
```

**Performance Optimization**:
```bash
> Our API response times have degraded 40% over the last month. Profile the codebase and optimize the slowest endpoints.

# Claude''s approach:
# - Analyze database queries
# - Check for N+1 problems
# - Review caching strategy
# - Optimize algorithm... (content truncated for import)',
